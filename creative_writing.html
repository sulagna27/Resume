    <p> <b> Creative Writing: </b>
        <br>Writing has the power to "express", may it be some article or essay, short stories, poems or novel, everything represents the ideas and emotions of the writer. Its been a few months since I started writing. Intially I started with writing
        quotes and then started to explore the other forms as well. I like writing short stories and poems. Its something that help me to unleash my creativity with words and form something that not only represents a particular idea but be appealing for
        the readers as well. I usually post my writing on YourQuote, a writing platform. You may check my works on YourQuote at
        <a href="https://www.yourquote.in/sulagna2704/">https://www.yourquote.in/sulagna2704</a>. I have added few of my works here. So enjoy reading and do provide your valuable feedback !!
