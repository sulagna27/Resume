    <p> <b> Reading: </b>
        <br> Extensive reading is something that can enable a person to gain a lot of knowledge without anyone's help. May it be scientific studies, textbooks or novels, everything contributes to learning something new. Reading helps me to know about
        views of other people and open up my views and helps to see a better picture. Not just it boosts my command in language but has also helped to enrich my vocabulary. I have been like a freak when it comes to reading novels and stories. Be it online
        or hardcopy, reading about Thrillers, Mysteries , Adventures, Paranormal activites have always fascinated me. Apart from this, I even like to read other genres.
        <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/"> Wattpad </a>, an online reading platform has mostly been my reading source. I will share some of the interesting works I came across and I guess you would love to try it as well.
