    <p> <b> Art: </b>
        <br>"Every shade has a story behind."
        <br>A painting or a sketch is a depiction of an idea, a thought unleashed through the medium of colors. A simple piece of art can represent the complexity of the idea, the imagination of a person flawlessly. Since my childhood, I have been interested
        in sketching and painting. My passion towards art has helped me to repesent my ideas creativity. Be it sketch or a painting , I love to represent my ideas and learn new forms as well. </p>
